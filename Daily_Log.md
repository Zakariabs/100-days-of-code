### Day 1: Mai 16, 2021 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I already have seen some chaptre of python in the past week. Now i am Learning Git and Github to learn to code properly.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through functions on freecodecamp and made some exercies. I also finished a lesson on sololearn. At the end i made a BMI-calculator.

**Thoughts** It feels so good to have finished the fucntions. I learned a lot from the online lessons. The way how the teachers explains the everything is good.

### Day 4: Mai 19

**Today's Progress**: In the morning on my way to my work i made train my knowledge on sololearn app. 
                      I dived played the second lesson back of iterations and loops and watched the third lesson on freecodecamp. 

**Thoughts** : Because of my internship and training i came to late. I do not have that time to focus at the evening. I prefer to practice in the morning.

### Day 6: Mai 21

**Today's Progress**: IRevised The  first 3 lessons of loops and iterations and finished the 4th one. Then I started the final exercice of the chaptre. 

**Thoughts** : I noticed if i do not learn seriously each day i will lose some of the knowledge. It is also important to make some exercices before hopping to the next chaptre. That's the only way to test my knowledge of that chaptre. I also took my time today beacuse i was enjoying the session ðŸ˜Š.

### Day 7: Mai 22

**Today's Progress**: I finished the chaptre exercice of iterations and loops. I took a look at the slights to see how to approch it. I made it after a long focus time. I learned several things like how to count and how to take an input and playing with it to the stop the loop without blowing the code up.

**Thoughts** : By taking my time by each lesson i noticed that i am more able to proces the information. By first trying the make the exercice before taking a look at the solutuins i noticed that i am able  to get the wanted results. How I approched the exercice was different than how the Professor did it. But i am learning a lot.
