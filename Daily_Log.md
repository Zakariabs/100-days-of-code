### Day 4: Mai 19

**Today's Progress**: In the morning on my way to my work i made train my knowledge on sololearn app. 
                      I dived played the second lesson back of iterations and loops and watched the third lesson on freecodecamp. 

**Thoughts** : Because of my internship and training i came to late. I do not have that time to focus at the evening. I prefer to practice in the morning.

### Day 5: Mai 20

**Today's Progress**: IToday was too lightweight. I only made a easy programming exercices that i saw on youtube.

### Day 6: Mai 21

**Today's Progress**: IRevised The  first 3 lessons of loops and iterations and finished the 4th one. Then I started the final exercice of the chaptre. 

**Thoughts** : I noticed if i do not learn seriously each day i will lose some of the knowledge. It is also important to make some exercices before hopping to the next chaptre. That's the only way to test my knowledge of that chaptre. I also took my time today beacuse i was enjoying the session ðŸ˜Š.

### Day 7: Mai 22

**Today's Progress**: I finished the chaptre exercice of iterations and loops. I took a look at the slights to see how to approch it. I made it after a long focus time. I learned several things like how to count and how to take an input and playing with it to the stop the loop without blowing the code up.

**Thoughts** : By taking my time by each lesson i noticed that i am more able to proces the information. By first trying the make the exercice before taking a look at the solutuins i noticed that i am able  to get the wanted results. How I approched the exercice was different than how the Professor did it. But i am learning a lot.

**Thoughts**: I got the feeling that i have to take one day break but i m not allowing myself to do dat. I noticed the big improvement that i make by doing the 100DAYSOFCODECHALLENGE. WHat i can try is try different ways by exploring the possibilitys and making some fun projects. 
I noticed that i forgot a little bit about he basics of the past courses. I have to go back and take a look at the details.

### Day 24: June 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished one topic in Jetbrains Academy and repeated one lesson and made some quizes and solved some problemes.
Solved one problem in Codewars.

**Thoughts**: I did not had the motivation to make the exercises. I did not sleep well the night before and did not train. 
That made me more unfocused.
